case matters for all of these
any unrecognised options will simply be ignored

-noChatLogs
    the bot will not log in game chat to console unless it is a command that the bot recognises and will attempt to execute

-host=xxxxx  (default: localhost)
    e.g. -host=hypixel.net
    specified the host URL or IP which the bot will connect to

-port=xxxxx  (default: 25565)
    e.g. -port=25565
    specifies the port which the bot will attempt to connect to the server via

-logToGameChat
    tells the bot to log its output to the in game chat as well as the console from which it was launched
    this is almost always a bad idea, and should not be used unless you trust the server that the bot is connected to
    the bot will log almost everything that it would notmally log to the console, so a lot of info may be leaked
