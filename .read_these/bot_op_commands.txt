any unrecognised commands will be ignored by the bot with no warning or error message
all prefixed by "-/bb_" e.g. the chat message "quit" will do nothing but "-/bb_quit" will cause the bot to exit

these commands are only executed when an operator of the bot is the one that types them into game chat

quit:
    the bot will quit and the script will end

kill:
    the bot will attempt to run the /kill command, and then respawn when dead

coords:
    the bot will spit its current coordinates into chat

tp_me:
    the bot will attempt to teleport to the player that typed this command

follow_me:
    the bot will follow the player that says this

follow_end:
    the bot will no longer follow anyone, and will forget its last target

follow_pause:
    the bot will keep its follow target but will not follow until someone calls follow_resume

follow_resume:
    the bot will continue to follow whoever it last was following

follow_target:
    the bot will put its current follow target into both game chat and the node console
